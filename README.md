# silent-ringtone-iphone

Just like it sounds: a silent ringtone for iPhone.

I created this repo because I like setting up my iPhone to "vibrate only" when sound is turned on, and "truly silent" when in silent mode (so my phone never rings or beeps in any way). To do this, you need to turn on "Vibrate on ring" _and_ have a silent ringtone. However, a (free) silent ringtone is just about impossible to find.

To set this up for yourself, clone this repo or download [Silence.m4r](https://github.com/pbaity/silent-ringtone-iphone/raw/master/Silence.m4r). Transfer the ringtone to your iPhone (you can drag and drop it into iTunes, for instance), then set your ringtone to "Silence." Turn on "Vibrate on ring" and turn off "Vibrate on silent." Then just make sure all other notifications are set up to vibrate only. 

## Setup: How to add the "Silent" ringtone to your iOS device

As of 2024 with iOS17, there is no longer an iTunes technique, but the Finder can be used to add ringtone files.

Steps:

1. Plug your iPhone or iPad into your Mac and select "Trust" on the phone pop-up dialog (needed for enabling file transfers).

2. Open Finder and select your device in the left hand bar.

3. Click "Manage Storage..." and open "Tones" section.

4. Then drag the downloaded [Silence.m4r](https://github.com/pbaity/silent-ringtone-iphone/raw/master/Silence.m4r) here.

You will now be able to select the "Silent" ringtone across all Apps on your device.

Pretty exiting, isn't it? :)
